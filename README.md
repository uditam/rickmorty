# Python App
Python webapp to parse a json respinse from rickandmortyapi.com and parse it to a csv file.
Here I used pandas to parse from json to csv and from csv to json.
## RIck and Morty API
API DOC can be found here:
https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#introduction
## Main functions
### main()
Main function of the app. Runs before staring the webapp server.
Its role is to fetch a response from ```url = "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/?Species=Human&status=alive&origin=earth"``` , validate its a valid json , and save it to local storage as a csv. In case any of the functions fails or gets an exception, the app with exit with ```sys.exit(1)``` exit code 1.
```
def main():
    try:
        response = download_json(url)
        validate_json(response)
        convert_json_to_csv(response)
    except ValueError as e:
        print("Couldn't fetch a valid json response and convert is to CSV. Exiting...")
        sys.exit(1)
```
### app.run()
Main loop of the wepapp server. It serves on port 5000, for all network interfaces.
## API Calls
### /healthcheck
Returns ```200``` http response with the body `Healthy!`
### /get_results
Returns a valid json response, after it parses the local .csv file to json using pandas.
# Dockerizig Python App
## Build
Includes a `build.sh` bash script. Please run `chmod u+x build.sh` for later use.
### Prerequisite
Create a dockerhub.conf file in the same directory. build.sh script is using it to have proper credentials to login to your dockerhub account. Structure of this file:
```
#----------------dockerhub.conf template-----------#
export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=<username>
export DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=<password>
#--------------------------------------------------#
```
In addition, the relevant repo should exist in your https://hub.docker.com/ account.
### Building
After configurating dockerhub.conf file,  you can run `./build.sh`. This script will:
- Docker build the python app, to create a new docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the repo.
- Install all pip packages.
- Expose port 5000.
- Login to the configured dockerhub account.
- Tag the created image.
- Push the image to dockerhub repo.
- Logout from dockerhub.
